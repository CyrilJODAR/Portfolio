                <h2>what about myself ?</h2>
                <p>Born the twenty second of May 1998 at Nouméa (Nouvelle Calédonie).</p>
                <p>Calm, Smiling and loves to discover new things.</p>
                <p>I am not the most sociable person but I can hold public speechs if needed, I'm used to them by now.</p>
                <p>I always give my best when doing something for anyone else other than me. We could say I'm fueled by the fear of being a disapointment.</p>
                <p>I have done a few group projects already, also managed some of them and by doing so i'm pretty confidant i can integrate an already functioning group or with a bit of time manage one. i'm also able to work independently on site or from home.</p>
